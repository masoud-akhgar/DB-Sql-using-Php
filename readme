- to see the sql tables and the size of project, please open ER.pdf
- On this page, according to the users actions, different requests are defined and embedded in Php codes.

According to ER diagram, I created tables in a way that the number of records to save data is minimized.
For example, I used "Channel_Bin_video" table to be linked with "Channel" table, so we have just one record to link a channel of video to a special video.
The types of connection between tables is revealed on ER diagram, so by watching the ER projects you can understand how the project was defined.


you can also download the folder and open "index.php" file using nginx or apache to see the simple UI.
